Contains eagle files for ArdustationUno. A Ground Control Station (GCS) arduino-compatible board, utilizing the same pin-outs as DIY Drones' Ardustation.

The required button board can be found separately and plugs into four of the six pins on the ATMEGA328p ISP header (GND, MOSI, MISO, SCK).

The header/jumper near the LiPo JST connector allows an external power switch.

Features include
- Powered by single cell LiPo
- Onboard USB Charger
- External button board for flexible enclosure design
- ATMEGA8U2 for USB -> Serial
- Logic level shifter for XBEE
- 5v switching step up regulator (based on MintyBoost)
- 3v3 LDO for XBEE
- All features found on DIY Drones Ardustation

Future possible improvements
- LCD Header doesn't line up exactly, so requires wires instead of headers for connection (see picture)
- All LEDs are SMT, no easy options for breaking out to button board
